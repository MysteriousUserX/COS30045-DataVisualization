        <div class="content-box">
          <h2>Why Energy Efficiency Matters</h2>
          <p>
            In Australia, household appliances account for approximately 33% of
            total residential electricity use. Understanding how much energy
            your appliances consume can help you make informed decisions that
            benefit both your wallet and the environment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
          <h2>Energy Rating Labels</h2>
          <p>
            The Australian Government's Energy Rating Label helps consumers
            compare the energy efficiency of household appliances. The more
            stars, the more efficient the appliance. Look for the Energy Rating
            Label when purchasing new appliances to ensure you're making an
            energy-smart choice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
          <h2>Average Household Energy Use</h2>
          <p>
            The average Australian household uses around 18 kilowatt-hours (kWh)
            of electricity per day. Major contributors include heating and
            cooling (40%), water heating (21%), and appliances including
            refrigerators and televisions (33%).

          <h2>TV Energy Facts</h2>
          <p>
            Televisions are one of the most commonly used appliances in
            Australian homes. The average TV is used for about 6 hours per day,
            and accounts for around 5-10% of household electricity consumption.

        <div class="content-box">
          <h2>Types of TVs and Energy Use</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>LED TVs:</strong> Most energy efficient, using 50-100 watts
            for a 50-inch screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OLED TVs:</strong> Moderate energy use, around 80-150 watts
            for similar sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Older Plasma/LCD:</strong> Higher consumption, potentially
            150-300 watts.

          <h2>Energy Saving Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce screen brightness to lower energy consumption</li>
            <li>Enable power-saving mode if available</li>
            <li>
              Turn off the TV completely rather than leaving it on standby
            </li>
            <li>Consider screen size - larger screens use more energy</li>
            <li>Look for TVs with high Energy Star ratings when purchasing</li>
