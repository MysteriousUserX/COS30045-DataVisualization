          <h2>Why This Data Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing a new TV involves more than just picking the largest screen
            you can afford. With rising electricity costs, understanding energy
            consumption can save you hundreds of dollars over your TV's
            lifetime. Our analysis of over 4,000 TV models reveals surprising
            patterns about size, technology, and power usage.

        <p class="intro">
          Navigate the TV market with confidence. Our data-driven insights help
          you understand what matters most when choosing your next television.

        <!-- Scene 1: Market Landscape -->
        <div class="story-scene">
          <span class="scene-number">01</span>
          <h2>The Market Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into specifications, let's understand what's actually
            available in the Australian market. Screen size is often the first
            decision buyers make, and the data reveals clear preferences.
          </p>
          <div class="scene-insight">
            💡 Key Insight: 55" and 65" TVs are the new standard. Smaller
            screens are becoming niche products.
          </div>
          <div class="chart-container" id="chart-sizes">
            <p style="color: #a8dadc">Loading chart...</p>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #a8dadc">
            The data shows a clear shift toward larger screens. If you're still
            considering a 32" or 40" TV, you may find fewer options as
            manufacturers focus on bigger displays.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Scene 2: Technology Choice -->
        <div class="story-scene">
          <span class="scene-number">02</span>
          <h2>The Technology Choice</h2>
          <p>
            LCD (LED-backlit) technology dominates the market, but OLED offers
            premium picture quality. What does the energy data tell us about
            these choices?
          </p>
          <div class="scene-insight">
            💡 Key Insight: LCD technology makes up over 95% of the market,
            offering the most variety and generally better energy efficiency.
          </div>
          <div class="chart-container" id="chart-tech">
            <p style="color: #a8dadc">Loading chart...</p>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #a8dadc">
            While OLED TVs offer stunning picture quality with perfect blacks,
            they come with higher energy consumption. LCD remains the practical
            choice for most buyers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Scene 3: Hidden Cost -->
        <div class="story-scene">
          <span class="scene-number">03</span>
          <h2>The Hidden Cost</h2>
          <p>
            Here's what the salesperson might not tell you: there's a strong
            correlation between screen size and power consumption. That dream
            85" TV comes with a significant ongoing electricity cost.
          </p>
          <div class="scene-insight">
            ⚠️ Warning: Moving from a 55" to an 85" TV can more than double your
            energy consumption!
          </div>
          <div class="chart-container" id="chart-power">
            <p style="color: #a8dadc">Loading chart...</p>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #a8dadc">
            Each dot represents a TV model. Notice how power consumption
            increases sharply with screen size. OLED models (orange) tend to
            cluster higher than LCD equivalents.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Scene 4: Brand Leaders -->
        <div class="story-scene">
          <span class="scene-number">04</span>
          <h2>The Major Players</h2>
          <p>
            Who are the market leaders? The number of registered models
            indicates which brands offer the widest selection for Australian
            consumers.
          </p>
          <div class="scene-insight">
            💡 Key Insight: Kogan, Samsung, and Hisense lead with the most model
            variety, giving consumers more choices across different price
            points.

            Based on our analysis of 4,160+ TV models, here are our

              <h3>🏆 Best for Energy Efficiency</h3>

                Choose an <strong>LCD (LED) TV</strong> in the
                <strong>55" range</strong>. You'll get a modern, popular screen
                size while keeping power consumption reasonable.

                Go for <strong>OLED</strong> if picture quality is your
                priority, but be prepared for higher energy costs. Consider
                55-65" to balance quality with efficiency.
